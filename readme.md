RHG Generator
Network generator for random hyperbolic graphs (RHGs) with a latent representation in a hyperbolic ball of any dimension d+1 >= 2. The generator returns the network in edgelist format and additionally a list of the node coordinates if desired. The generator can be operated in 2 different modes: hybrid and model-based. In hybrid mode, the user provides the desired average degree, temperature and power-law exponent of the resulting network. In model-based mode, the user provides all network parameters. See Required Parameters for the full lists of the required parameters per mode.

Dependencies
C++ 2011 compiler or newer (std=c++11)
Library gsl, GNU Scientific Library (version >= 1.16).
Setup
Install the required libraries using a package manager of choice.
Clone the repository.
git clone https://gbudel@bitbucket.org/gbudel/rhg-generator.git 
Navigate to the directory rhg-generator and invoke the make command.
cd rhg-generator
make
If compiling fails, please check if the required compiler and libraries are present and can be found by the compiler.
To clean up build objects after successful compilation, invoke the make clean command.
make clean
Usage
Call the executable generate_rhg with the mode of choice (model-based or hybrid) and provide the required parameters. Parameter flags and values should be separated by a whitespace, e.g., -n 1000 sets the number of nodes to 1,000. A full list of the available parameters and which parameters are required in which mode can found below. The inputs are tested for the restriction within parentheses.

Parameters
-f filename (either a *.dat filename or a filename without extension).
-n network size (int > 1).
-d dimensionality parameter d for the dimensionality d + 1 of the hyperbolic ball (int >= 1).
-m model-based mode (select one from {-m, -h}.
-h hybrid-mode (select one from {-m, -h}.
-t rescaled temperature tau (float >= 0).
-g negative power-law exponent gamma for P(k) ~ k^(-gamma) (float >= 2).
-a radial component a (float >= 1).
-nu scaling parameter nu (float > 0).
-radius rescaled radius R of the hyperbolic ball (float > 0).
-v (optional) a switch whether or not to export node coordinates after generation (<filename>.coord.dat).
-seed (optional) the seed for the pseudorandom generator (long != 0).
Required Parameters
Always required: -f AND -n AND -d.
-m model-based mode: -t AND [-nu OR -radius] AND [-g OR -a].
-h hybrid mode: -k AND -t AND [-g OR -a].
Output
The following files will be created in the project directory.

<filename>.dat the network in edge list format with node indices separated by a whitespace.
<filename>.meta.dat a meta file with the chosen/computed network parameters.
<filename>.coord.dat (optional) a list of the node coordinates in the hyperbolic ball.
Examples
Hybrid mode: generate a network with n = 10,000 nodes for dimensionality d = 3, average degree <k> = 10, power-law exponent gamma = 2.1 in the cold regime (tau = 1/2).
```
./generate_rhg -f example.dat -n 10000 -d 3 -h -g 2.1 -k 10 -t 0.5
Model-based mode: generate a network with n = 1,000 nodes for dimensionality d = 1, radial component a = 1, scaling parameter nu = 0.5 in the hot regime (tau = 3/2) and export the coordinates with the -v switch afterwards.
```
./generate_rhg -f example.dat -n 1000 -d 1 -m -a 1.0 -nu 0.5 -t 1.5 -v
Numerical considerations
To prevent numerical issues within the computations, the following cut-off values in the parameters are applied based on the user inputs:

When tau < 0.05, links are generated deterministically as if tau = 0 (and when tau < 0, an error is thrown).
When |tau - 1| < 0.01, the scaling of the critical regime tau = 1 is invoked.
When tau >= 1.01, the scaling of the hot regime tau > 1 is invoked, and the parameters must adhere to gamma <= tau + 1, otherwise an error is thrown (because the parameters imply a < 1).
When a < 1.01, the scaling of the case a = 1 is invoked (and when a < 1, an error is thrown).
When a > 2400/R, all radial coordinates will be very large and they cannot be reliably generated, therefore we resort to degenerate hyperbolic graphs where each radial coordinate r = R.
In the critical regime tau = 1, a > 1, the Lambert function W(x) is evaluated using a look-up table of function values and linear intrapolation, closely resembling the true function values.
If n <= 10^7, trigonometric function values sin(theta) and cos(theta) are pre-calculated and stored in memory for all nodes in order to speed up calculations. If n > 10^7, these function values are not pre-calculated in order to save memory.
In the current implementation, the maximum network size is n = 10^9. Note that for large dimensionality d, the memory can already get full for network sizes n < 10^9. The software contains memory exception handlers for this purpose and will throw an error in case the machine runs out of memory.
